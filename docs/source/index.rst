Welcome to MJ's documentation about my project during A level Computer Science!
===================================

My python project was a **registration system** for a martial arts gym. This project had 2 end users: The staff members of the gym, the clients of the gym. I seperated the end users by using "the login menu". This worked by depending on the information the user has inputted it would direct them to a page for them. E.g if the user inputed "Admin" for their username and their password as "!LikeCh1ck3n" it would direct them to a page for staffs only which displayed clients details, events, schedules when 1 to 1 training would happen. 

.. note::

   It is finished. Paperwork sucks indeed.
